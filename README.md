# WorkFlowy Calendar Generator
This tool helps you generate a list for a given period of time. Originally having written in Node.js, I am now in the process of rebuilding it in Python to run on PythonAnywhere.com.

## How-to start the Node.js version
1. Open your terminal
1. `cd` into the `node` folder
1. (Run `npm install` before the first time, to install all dependencies)
1. Run `npm start` (or `npm run debug` if you want to use your Chrome browser's debugging on the Node instance)
1. Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser

## Troubleshooting
1. If you're having trouble pasting in Firefox, try in Chrome
